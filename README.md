# About the Project
## Information
![CALCULATOR_SHOWCASE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/65184258/97081589-4eec0f80-15fb-11eb-8ecf-fe7fc9587bf9.png)

This project is a simple calculator application. It features **integrated keyboard control** and **two light and dark themes** to keep your eyes happy.
This was my first project where I fullly integrated the keyboard so you don't really need to spend time clicking all the buttons.

Calculator by Kevin Apetrei makes it easier to use Software Calculators by keeping a clean design and allowing you to spend less time clicking on buttons
and more time calculating!
